# Design Decisions

- The app uses the Google Maps Android API to display the map and interact with location-related services.
- Location services are checked and enabled/disabled prompts are shown to the user if necessary.
- The app incorporates a search feature to find nearby locations based on user-provided keywords.
- Place details are retrieved using the Google Places API and displayed to the user.
- Bottom sheets are used for filtering and displaying location details.
- The app uses the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture for separation of concerns and easier testing.
- Permissions for accessing user location are requested at runtime when necessary.
